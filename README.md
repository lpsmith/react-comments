This is my take on [Facebook's React
tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).   The
main contributions are:

1. Backing the tutorial with a Snap 1.0 web application server.

2. Using HTML5 server-sent events instead of periodic polling.

3. Automatic page reloading,  tested on Firefox and Chrome.  Just
   save your changes to the static contents and go!

This probably isn't interesting to anybody else, except maybe as an
example.  I'm using it as a experimental playground for Snap 1.0,
HTML5 events,  and especially React.
